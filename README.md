Cybel Discord Bot

i made this a while ago. 
i am currently in the works of making it more readable, and updating a lot of the code


update: moving a lot of things to await/async, removed garbage (like sendMessage2, etc), and split up the one file into some separate modules. you can now actually run the bot, and connect to voice + play music

keep in mind, it is still a big wip and there will be issues if you try running it, feel free to offer suggestions.

also dont forget to download ffmpeg and put it in the root folder, working on trying to change the location
